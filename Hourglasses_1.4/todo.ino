Align all hourglasses at NOON - DONE
Missing time at midnight? - DONE ("break")
Test that negative numbers in the morning do in fact work - DONE

Change noon animation to flip in a wave rather than simply all flip at the same time
- noon animation has dual purpose of reducing number of simultaneously active HGs (and therefore load)

- stop timer: Switch off hourglasses using a prime time
- Reference array defining order (distance from start?)
- Multiply reference array by timing constant (i.3., 300ms, in ~100ms)
- compare to MS + MS reference
- flip at time
- restart timer thingamadinger
